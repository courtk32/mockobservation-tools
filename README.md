# my_tools

These are tools I have created to aid in my research of Galaxy Simulations. Several of the tools are made to create mock images from the FIRE simulations and measure them using observation techniques, like Sersic Profiles Fiting. 

Several of the tools in galaxy_tools make use or are adapted from FIRE studio, a code created by Alex Gurvich https://ascl.net/2202.006
